# Data-Structures-Algorithms-Assignments

Assignment 1: implemented an algorithm using two approaches: iterative and recursive (tail and non-tailrecursions). For each case, I plot running time as a function of
n and compare the achieved results.

Assignment 2: implemented different ways to make a LinkedList and plotted a running time as a function and compared results.
